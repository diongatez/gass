Added support for the latest AMD drivers under Linux 19.30-934563 and for mining with RX5700 cards under Linux. Note that drivers are quite buggy and most of the overclocking options don't work, as well as most of the hardware monitoring options.
Added a new flexible way for setting GPU-specific options with selectors. Example: -cclock 1-3:1090,4:1300 -mclock nvidia:+450,amd:2000,*:1900,gtx*1070*ti:+200 See Readme.txt for more information.
Added command-line option -gbase to set 0-base or 1-based GPU indexes (the default is 1). With -gbase 1 (the default), the first GPU is GPU1, then GPU2, etc. With -gbase 0 the first GPU is GPU0, second - GPU1, etc. Note that this also changes the indexes that are used with all command line options that accept GPU indexes (e.g. -gpus) as well as these used with the interactive commands on the miner shell window
Validated support for the latest AMD Windows drivers 19.11.3 (but they already work with 4.7c because there were no significant changes in the OpenCL driver)
Other small improvements and fixes.
