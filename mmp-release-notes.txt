Added optimized kernels for AMD RX5700 (Navi) GPUs under Windows (you need AMD driver 19.9.1 to use these kernels)
Implemented hardware control (setting clocks, voltages, power limit, fan control) for AMD cards under Linux. Requires PhoenixMiner running with root permissions. The clocks and voltage control require relatively new drivers (tested on 19.30-855429) and adding the following boot parameter to Linux kernel: amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff
Added advanced hardware stats (-hstats 2) for Nvidia cards under Linux
Added advanced hardware stats (-hstats 2) for AMD cards under Linux (requires relatively new drivers)
