Added more Pascal-based Nvidia cards to the list of supported Nvidia cards for memory timing (straps).
Added new parameter -nvmem to force using straps even on unsupported Nvidia GPUs (use -nvmem 1 for GDDR5 cards, or -nvmem 2 for GDDR5X cards).
Removed some dead ethash-based altcoins and updated the support for the rest of them.
Other small fixes.
