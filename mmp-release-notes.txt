Added support for DAG epochs up to 500
Fixed crash (or GPUs not detected error) when using the latest Windows Nvidia drivers 460.79 and 460.89
Validated support for Nvidia RTX 3090, 3080, 3070, and 3060Ti GPUs. Those still use the current kernels and there are no speed increases from the previous PhoenixMiner release
Add support for the older AMD Linux driver 19.50-1011208-ubuntu-18.04 (used by some Linux mining OSes and other software)
Added new kernels to allow mining on AMD Hawaii cards (R9 390, etc.) with the current and future DAG epochs (even with DAG buffer above 4GB for the 8GB cards). Note that the AMD Windows drivers do not support compute mode for Hawaii cards, so the hashrate will be quite low (14-15 MH/s with the current ETH DAG epoch). This problem is fixed under Linux, where you can get the full 29-30 MH/s speed out of the Hawaii cards.
