Added support for the latest AMD drivers under Linux 19.30-934563 and for mining with RX5700 cards under Linux. Note that drivers are quite buggy and most of the overclocking options don't work, as well as most of the hardware monitoring options.
Added a new flexible way for setting GPU-specific options with selectors. Example: -cclock 1-3:1090,4:1300 -mclock nvidia:+450,amd:2000,*:1900,gtx*1070*ti:+200 See bellow for more information
Validated support for the latest AMD Windows drivers 19.11.1 (but they already work with 4.7c because there were no significant changes in the OpenCL driver)
Other small improvements and fixes.
