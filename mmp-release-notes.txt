Added support for VRAM timing adjustments for Nvidia cards of 10x0 series (see the new command
line parameter -straps, -vmt1, -vmt2, -vmt3, and -vmr for more information)
Added -ttli option to automatically decrease the mining speed to avoid overheating the GPUs over
the target temperature (useful when -tmax option is not supported by the drivers)
Fixed long-standing problems with -gpow option, which now works properly
Added support for latest AMD drivers 20.7.1 under Windows and 20.20-1089974 under Linux
Many other small improvements and fixes
