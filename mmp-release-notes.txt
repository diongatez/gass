New kernels for AMD Vega and Navi GPUs that are slightly faster when the DAG buffer is approaching or passing 4GB in size (the current ETH DAG is close to 4GB). To use these new kernels, you need to use drivers 20.5.1 or later under Win10, or 20.10.x or later under Linux
Automatic re-running auto-tune as needed when switching to a different DAG buffer type (e.g. when switching from ETH to ETC, or back)
Added support for the latest AMD Windows 10 drivers 20.12.1 and 20.11.3
Fixed crash when trying to set -mvddc on very old AMD drivers (including the beta blockchain drivers from 2017)
Other small fixes and improvements
