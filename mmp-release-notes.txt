Added support for -daglim for AMD Fiji, Tonga, and Baffin cards with 4GB VRAM, so you will be able to use them some time beyond epoch 373 (Windows), or 381 (Linux)
New kernels for 4GB AMD cards with higher hashrate when -daglim is in effect
Added -daglim and -rxboost support in Linux. The default -daglim value in Linux is 4064 for older drivers (before 19.50), and 4076 for the newer drivers
Added support for the AMD Linux drivers 20.20, and 20.30
Added support for the latest AMD Linux drivers 20.40-1147286 (however they seem to have hardware control problems with some cards, so no need to upgrade for now)
The kernels are modified to allow bigger DAG limit of 4023 MB under Windows. This allows higher hashrate when the DAG is bigger than the available VRAM.
The -daglim parameter is now on "auto" (1) by default and it sets the DAG limit to 4023, so you don't need to set -daglim 1 or -daglim 4023 if the default value is working fine.
AMD cards with more than 4 GB RAM will now work without issues until DAG epoch 450
Added new -daglim parameter to allow a few more weeks of work for 4 GB AMD Polaris cards. Use -daglim 1 for automatic operation, or specify a concrete value for the maximum DAG size (example: -daglim 4000 will set max DAG size 4000 MB)
Added -rxboost parameter (also accessible via -vmr) to boost the performance of GDDR5 based AMD cards (Polaris or earlier)
Added memory straps support for AMD Vega cards. Use the -straps command-line option to activate it (example: -straps 1 will activate the lowest strap level)
The Nvidia memory timing (straps) option is improved and now is turned off during DAG generation to avoid any possible instability issues
Many other small improvements and fixes
